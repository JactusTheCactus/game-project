											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>the player may need to get close
											<ul>
												<li>there is no line-of-sight to shoot targets</li>

										</li>

											<ul>

									complete
									the mission</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What kind of emergent play is possible?
					<ul>
						<li>players are not constrained or railroaded into a single solution</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What is the story structure? Does it help the players know how to play?
					<ul>
						<li>the player plays as "Seeker," a mercenary contracted to kill high-ranking members of
							Siberia's corrupt elite
							<ul>
								<li>Siberia is now a country separate from Russia</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How does the playspace/board constrain or enable player agency or choice?
					<ul>
						<li>the player is given free reign of how to complete the objective with the tools at their
							disposal
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>How does the game provide feedback to the player?
					<ul>
						<li>sometimes a shot will trigger the bullet-cam
							<ul>
								<li>time slows</li>
								<li>camera follows the bullet
									<ul>
										<li>from being fired from the gun</li>
										<li>to it hitting the target</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

							<ul>
								<li>headshots</li>
								<li>multikills</li>
								<li>mine kills</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What kind of emotions does the game provoke on the player? How does the player stay motivated?
					<ul>
						<li>the missions are short, with only ~5 missions per map, ensuring the player doesn't get tired
							of
							the same thing over and over</li>
						<li>5 Maps x 5 Missions = 25 Total Missions</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What aspects of the design are mechanic-driven? Are there story-driven elements?
					<ul>
						<li>the game is largely mechanic-focused, with the story sometimes taking a backseat</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Is the game replayable? Are there several paths to win or just one?
					<ul>
						<li>there is one ending to the game / each mission, but the route taken in each mission is
							completely up
							to the player</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>What is the gameâ€™s target audience?</li>
				<li>Did you have fun playing it? Why or why not? What was your favorite part and your least favorite?
					Why?
					<ul>
						<li>i loved playing it</li>
						<li>getting a perfect shot from the opposite side of the map is a great feeling</li>
						<li>however, getting counter-sniped 13 times in a row is not</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
