				This is a template, and it is in no way a restrictive document. Feel
				free to change it and make it your own. We know all ideas are different
				and some elements might not apply to yours, while others are missing.
				Keep it brief. It should be easy to read and follow for you and other
				team members. Write it as a group. Unless you are working alone, involve
				the whole team. Change it as you wish. Do not limit yourself, let the
				design document change as your game design progresses. Make it your
				document. Add images, videos, gifs, jokes. Anything goes!
