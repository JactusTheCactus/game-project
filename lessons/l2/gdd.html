We know all ideas are different and some elements might not apply to yours, while others are missing. Keep it brief. It should be easy to read and follow for you and other team members. Write it as a group. Unless you are working alone, involve the whole team. Change it as you wish. Do not limit yourself, let the design document change as your game design progresses. Make it your document. Add images, videos, gifs, jokes. Anything goes!</code>
